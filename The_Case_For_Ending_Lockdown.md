# The case for ending the "lockdown"

The following lays out what we now know about the Coronavirus epidemic, and upon review of the evidence concludes that **the unprecedented policy of "lockdown" is likely to result in far more morality than the best alternative**. In short, this is because the lockdown harms the entire country, whereas death and serious complications due to Covid-19, while incredibly tragic, effects an extremely limited subset of the population when compared to the effects of the lockdown itself.

## Quick Review

A novel coronavirus, now dubbed SARS-CoV-2, emerged in late 2019 in China from a zoonotic source, and very quickly spread to the rest of the world, rapidly becoming the most serious pandemic in over a century.

Evidence shows that the virus is rapidly transmissible between humans. The primary source of transmission is believed to via infected respiratory droplets. When the viral particles within these droplets eventually make their ways to mucous membranes, such as the eyes, nose, mouth, or sexual organs, exposure occurs and infection may result.

The condition that results is known as Covid-19, and bears the characteristic marks of .

In response, countries around the world have taken a series of unprecedented actions. For our purposes, we are going to focus on the path taken by the United States.

Upon the recommendation of top public health officials, the United States enacted a serious of increasingly draconian measures, culminating in the forced shutdown of large swaths of the US economy that were deemed "non-essential".

These policies vary depending on the exact state and county in question.

Extreme action seemed justified based off of the figures that were publicly available in early 2020. Troublingly, as new, better data has emerged, public policy has not changed accordingly, and indeed in many cases the "goalposts have been moved". Public health and media messaging around the lockdowns were centered around the idea of "flattening the curve": a policy wherein measures are taken to slow tranmission of the virus in order to avoid a capacity over-run of the healthcare system that would result in excess mortality. These measures were based on the projections of models such as those advocated by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IMHE), which have been shown to have poor predictive value and to have massively overstated the numbers of hospitalizations, deaths, and therefore hospital capacity (ventilators, hospital beds, staff) necessary to effectively manage the crisis.

Weeks and months later, facts on the ground show that the purported collapse of the healthcare system did not occur. Moreover, this was not due to success in seriously curtailing the spread in hard-hit areas like New York, but was rather due to the aforementioned discovery that COVID-19, while extremely deadly in certain subsets of the population, was not nearly as deadly as thought. We'll discuss the IMHE model later in this article, in section $TODO, but enough on that for now.

**One problem that I believe has not been adequately addressed by our leaders is the poor understanding of how infections spread, what a virus actually is, and how the immune system detects, fights off, and guards against future occurrences of previously-seen pathogens.** To that end, this article will be broken up into a series of sections. The first section, "The Basics", will cover the absolute minimum that every citizen should know about epidemiology and immunology. The second section, "How serious is this thing?", will cover emerging evidence regarding the transmission rate, lethality, and hospitalization rate of Covid-19. We'll see that current evidence strongly contradicts the models and figures upon which our public policy has purportedly been designed. The third section, "Lockdown-associated destabilization and mortality", will cover some of the theoretical and observed deleterious (negative) effects of the lockdown. The fourth section, "The sane alternative", covers a proposed alternative for a Covid-19 mitigation policy. The fifth section, "The soul of our country is at stake", examines the attitudes and beliefs that have led to widely respected public health officials resorting to policies that do not stand up to evidence-based examination, and furthermore examines the ethics and constitutionality of those policies.

Finally, the intent of this article is to use the most precise language possible, while still remaining largely understandable to a citizen of average intelligence and education level. Indeed, I (we) have truly succeeded if this article is understandable to those who no fault of their own have significantly _below_ average intelligence and/or educational attainment. This crisis effects us all and we should write and speak in a way that is accessible to all. To that end, the final section is a TL;DR which uses only those words that are understandable by an elementary-school aged child, and focuses on reviewing the absolute most important points.

## The victory of superstition over science (META: won't include this section so that we can stay laser-focused, but will leave this in the initial commit)

**Public health officials and political leaders have taken the unprecedented step of recommending measures that appear to be based on superstition rather than based on an evidence-based understanding of the etiology of covid transmission.**

This phenomenom is most strikingly viewed in the widespread usage of "thought-terminating phrases", such as "flatten the curve", "stay home", etc. These phrases are used to terminate a discussion by pointing to a supposed self-evident fact, and dissent regarding the utility of these measures has been met with unprecedented levels of censorship that has been enabled, or more accurately shepherded, by platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.




## Debunking the unproven assumption that "the lockdown worked"

Care must be taken to distinguish between the various measures enacted:

- Recommending a minimum 6 foot distance between social groups
- Recommending widespread use of cloth facial coverings to attempt to curtail spread of respiratory droplets
- Closure of schools across the nation, from pre-schools up to universities.
- Forced shutdown of businesses across the country
