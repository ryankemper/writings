# The case for ending the "lockdown"

The following lays out what we now know about the Coronavirus epidemic, and upon review of the evidence concludes that **the unprecedented policy of "lockdown" is likely to result in far more morality than the best alternative**. In short, this is because the lockdown harms the entire country, whereas death and serious complications due to COVID-19, while incredibly tragic, effects an extremely limited subset of the population when compared to the effects of the lockdown itself.

Furthermore, it seems likely, although it cannot be said for sure, that beyond increasing mortality from non-COVID-19 sources, that the policy of lockdown as well as the general culture of widespread fear may lead to us experiencing more COVID-19 deaths than we otherwise would have suffered. We'll dig into those details further on in this article, but for now it should be noted that the effects of social isolation, joblessness, and limited exposure to the outside world, are known to be heavily correlated with increased mortality through a number of independent mechanisms of action.

We characterize the root of United States policy towards the pandemic to be based upon the idea of "Containment", despite leaders like Anthony Fauci having stated that containment is no longer an option ($TODO: link to video of his quote). That is to say, our leaders have been saying one thing, but our actual actions appear to say the opposite. In contrary to our current policy, we advocate for a policy of what we are calling "Pareto Mitigation" (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle): a policy wherein the most vulnerable among us (primarily the elderly) are encouraged to self-isolate ("shelter in place"), while the majority of society is no longer prohibited from working and transacting more or less "as normal", with the exception of large gatherings and a policy of encouragement of _voluntary_ usage of masks and physical distancing.

Care has been taken to be thorough while limiting the raw length of this writeup. As expected with a public health challenge this unique and unprecedented, it takes a lot of words to do the subject justice. For those short on time or who have difficulty understanding technical language, you are advised to skip to Section $TODO, "TLDR", which explains the important parts in simple language.

## Quick Review

A novel coronavirus, now dubbed SARS-CoV-2, emerged in late 2019 in China from a zoonotic source, and very quickly spread to the rest of the world, rapidly becoming the most serious pandemic in over a century.

Evidence shows that the virus is rapidly transmissible between humans. The primary source of transmission is believed to be via infected _respiratory droplets_. When the viral particles within these droplets eventually make their ways to mucous membranes, such as the eyes, nose, mouth, or sexual organs, exposure occurs and infection may result.

The condition that results is known as COVID-19, and bears the characteristic marks of acute respiratory illness. A sizeable portion of those infected are either asymptomatic (no symptoms), or paucisymptomatic (few symptoms)

In response, countries around the world have taken a series of unprecedented actions. For our purposes, we are going to focus on the path taken by the United States.

Upon the recommendation of top public health officials, the United States enacted a serious of increasingly draconian measures, culminating in the forced shutdown of large swaths of the US economy that were deemed "non-essential".

These policies vary depending on the exact state and county in question.

Initially, extreme action seemed justified based off of the figures that were publicly available in early 2020. Troublingly, as new, better data has emerged, public policy has not changed accordingly, and indeed in many cases the "goalposts have been moved". Public health and media messaging around the lockdowns was initially centered around the seductively popular idea of "flattening the curve": a policy wherein measures are taken to slow tranmission of the virus in order to avoid a capacity over-run of the healthcare system that would result in excess mortality. These measures were based on the projections of models such as those advocated by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IMHE), which have been shown to have poor predictive value and to have massively overstated the numbers of hospitalizations, deaths, and therefore hospital capacity (ventilators, hospital beds, staff) necessary to effectively manage the crisis.

Weeks and months later, facts on the ground show that the purported collapse of the healthcare system did not occur. Moreover, this was not due to success in seriously curtailing the spread in hard-hit areas like New York, but was rather due to the aforementioned discovery that COVID-19, while extremely deadly in certain subsets of the population, was not nearly as deadly overall as previously thought. We'll discuss the IMHE model later in this article, in section $TODO, but enough on that for now. Confronted with the reality of having "succeeded" in avoiding the collapse of the healthcare system, albeit arguably not due to the lockdown policy, policymakers have _not_ lifted the lockdown restrictions in much of the country, but on the contrary appear to have shifted the goal to a goal of containment: staying locked down until COVID-19 has been suppressed to such an extent that it becomes feasible to perform widespread location tracking (dubbed "contact tracing"). Indeed, the current policy seems to be one of "indefinite postponement", the key assumption being that it is feasible to avoid exposure to SARS-CoV-2 until a safe and effective vaccine is developed and delivered to the global population. We are going to examine

**One problem that we believe has not been adequately addressed by our leaders is the poor understanding of how infections spread, what a virus actually is, and how the immune system detects, fights off, and guards against future occurrences of previously-seen pathogens.** To that end, this article will be broken up into a series of sections. The first section, "The Basics", will cover the absolute minimum that every citizen should know about epidemiology and immunology. The second section, "How serious is COVID-19?", will cover emerging evidence regarding the transmission rate, lethality, and hospitalization rate of COVID-19. We'll see that current evidence strongly contradicts the models and figures upon which our public policy has purportedly been designed. The third section, "Lockdown-associated destabilization and mortality", will cover some of the theoretical and observed deleterious (negative) effects of the lockdown. The fourth section, "Pareto Mitigation: An evidence-based approach", covers a proposed alternative for a COVID-19 mitigation policy. The fifth section, "The Road to Hell is Paved With Good Intentions: Censorship and Superstition", examines the attitudes and beliefs that have led to widely respected public health officials resorting to policies that do not stand up to evidence-based examination, and furthermore examines the ethics and constitutionality of those policies.

Finally, the intent of this article is to use the most precise language possible, while still remaining largely understandable to a citizen of average intelligence and education level. Indeed, we have truly succeeded if this article is understandable to those who (through no fault of their own, to be clear) may have significantly _below_ average intelligence and/or educational attainment. **This crisis effects us all and thus we should write and speak in a way that is accessible to all**. To that end, the final section is a "TL;DR" which uses only those words that are understandable by an elementary-school aged child, and focuses on reviewing the absolute most important points.

## Section 1: The Basics

First we need to understand what a [virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus) is. A _virus_ is a type of infectious agent that uses the living cells of an organism to _replicate_ (reproduce itself). Generally this involves the virus "infecting" a cell and re-purposing its cellular machinery to manufacture thousands more viruses, until eventually the cell dies and the new "baby viruses" explode out of the cell, at which point they attempt to infect further cells. Viruses are extremely tiny: often around 1/100 the size of a "normal bacteria".

Next, we should understand the very basics of how our immune systems interact with viruses. The immune system is an incredibly intricate choreography composed of numerous different cell types. At a high level, the immune system's job is to distinguish "self" from "non-self" (the "enemy", in this case the SARS-CoV-2 virus). The immune system learns to adapt to [antigens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen), which are molecules that can be used to recognize a type of pathogen. Once an antigen corresponding to a pathogen is detected, the immune system manufactures [antibodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody), which can attach to antigens in order to directly neutralize pathogens, or indirectly to help other killer immune cells to neutralize the pathogen.

After the immune system successfully fights off an infection such as COVID-19, antibodies continue to circulate in the blood for some type, which is believed to prevent re-infection so long as sufficient antibodies are present. Eventually, these antibodies may no longer be present, but the immune system maintains _Memory B Cells_ which lie dormant, waiting to be exposed to the characteristic antigens that the immune system saw previously, at which point they spring to life, producing antibodies at a rapid rate. Thus, even if the body no longer had circulating antibodies in the blood, these memory cells allow the body to respond sooner, resulting in a more mild infection with lower peak viral load. Thus, while it _may_ be possible to be re-infected with SARS-CoV-2 after sufficient type has past (exactly how long is a matter of open research), these immune memory cells persist across decades and thus recovery means that that individual is much less likely to fall seriously ill, and overall will spread the virus much less than if there were no immunity. This mechanism is robust and well-studied, and thus while we are still researching exactly how long full immunity lasts as opposed to the "partial" immunity of memory cells, it is an incredibly safe assumption that this process works for SARS-CoV-2 as it does for any other coronavirus.

So, we've covered the basics of viruses and the immune system at the "individual" level, and now we need to talk about the "population" level. A critical concept to understand, and indeed one that has been unfairly criticized, is the concept of _herd immunity_. **Herd immunity is the natural result of individual immunity as applied to population-level dynamics**. That is to say, **herd immunity is a natural process** that happens when a pathogen has worked itself through enough of the population. Specifically, once the proportion of recovered in the population reaches `1/(1-R_0)`, there are no longer enough vectors (infectable indviduals) remaining for a serious outbreak to occur. It's worth noting that this is the same principle that vaccination relies upon; vaccination is just an artificial way to build immunity without having to undergo a full infection.

In order to talk about how infectious and how deadly COVID-19 is, there's three important epidemiological concepts that need to be understood:

   (1) [Basic reproduction number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number): Also called "R Nought", this number intuitively represents how many other people the average infected person goes on to infect. This number needs to be at or below 1 in order to contain a disease. We classify how easily a disease spreads by its reproduction number, but note that there is not one "real" reproduction number. It's a function of environmental conditions, social interaction, government policies, etc.

   (2) [Case fatality rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_fatality_rate) The proportion of _detected cases_ that result in death. This number will be higher than the "infection fatality rate" (the true "death rate") if there are undetected cases (as there are with COVID-19).

   (3) [Infection fatality rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_fatality_rate#Terminology) The "true" death rate of an illness: in essence, it answers the question "what percentage of all people who get this thing are going to die?" We'll be talking a lot about the IFR of COVID-19 in the following section.

There's one last concept to cover: testing. Currently there's two broad categories of tests:

(1) PCR tests, which tells us whether someone actively has an infection of SARS-CoV-2 viral material

(2) _Serological_ (antibody) tests, which tell us whether someone has active circulating antibodies that respond to SARS-COV-2, which implies that they were previously infected (or perhaps are at the tail end of a current infection). These tests are critical for estimating the _prevalence_ of COVID-19 in the population.

Now that we've hopefully got these fundamental concepts down, it's time to talk about COVID-19 specifically.

## Section 2: How serious is COVID-19?

Initial reports claimed that COVID-19 had a CFR of around 4-5% and a shocking 20% hospitaliation ratio. Fortunately, these initial reports don't tell the full story. We have since discovered via serological testing that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 massively understates the true prevalence of infection, and therefore that the true infection fatality rate is far lower than we might have assumed.

[One dutch antibody study](https://esb.nu/blog/20059695/we-kunnen-nu-gaan-rekenen-aan-corona) (not in English, unfortunately) gives us the following age-stratified hospitalization and mortality figures: https://old.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/g4tqvk/dutch_antibody_study_of_blood_donors_reveals_3/fnzkn4k/

A recent [danish antibody study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.24.20075291v1) concluded the following: "combined IFR in patients younger than 70 is estimated at 82 per 100,000".

Shifting to CFR, we have an [excellent study of italian healthcare workers](https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/bollettino/Bollettino-sorveglianza-integrata-COVID-19_16-aprile-2020.pdf) which gives us these figures: https://old.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/g6nmtf/update_on_italian_progression_of_covid19/foatvgv/

Why are these Italian numbers so much lower than CFRs reported elsewhere? Presumbably because the majority of these healthcare workers were tested, whereas CFR figures from other sources are missing anywhere from 2-100 cases for every case that's been discovered, leading to wildly inflated purported fatality rates.

In short, we see that the general IFR is somewhere between .1-.7% depending upon if you account for the lack of <18 year olds in many of these serology studies. Much more striking than the general figure is the **truly massive variance in risk based upon age**.

Comparisons have been made, both affirmatively and negatively, towards Influenza. So let's talk about how Influenza is different from Covid, and in what ways it's similar.

Influenza is characterized by a pattern of mortality in which the **very young** and the **very old** have an extremely high chance of death [citation](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-10-162#Fig1) [1], perhaps due to the "cytokine storm" which is a "scorched-earth"-style overreaction triggered by the immune system. In comparison, COVID-19 has a pattern of mortality where the **very old are extremely vulnerable**, whereas **COVID-19 is stunningly _not_ deadly in the very young**. A disease like COVID-19, which has such a "spiky" (highly variable) mortality rate based upon age and other comorbidities, is a _terrible_ candidate for a national lockdown, because **lockdown does not distinguish between those at risk and those who are not at risk**. This pattern of mortality is something we should be celebrating - **we have strong evidence that our children are safe**, and thus if anything in children it is rational to worry about Influenza, not COVID-19 - but unfortunately the wider population is not aware of this fact due to misleading or outright false statements propagated by the media and even, at times, our trusted public health officials.

In short, the [statement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DekzGCJhJw&feature=youtu.be&t=53) by Dr. Fauci that COVID-19 is likely an order of magnitude deadlier than the flu has not held up to scrutiny. (To his credit, he was fairly clear that he was estimating it based off the data at the time, which we certainly cannot fault him for).



## Section 3: Lockdown-associated destabilization and mortality

## Section 4: Pareto Mitigation: An evidence-based approach
    - Encourage at-risk groups to self quarantine, and utilize testing to protect them
        * All elderly, ESPECIALLY NURSING HOMES (all entrants to nursing homes need to take tests, wear face masks, wash hands, etc)
        * Those with obesity and COPD
            - Not sure about: "just" hypertension, just diabetes
    - All others are ALLOWED to work and transact freely. If they are too afraid to, perhaps (not sure about this) allow to collect unemployment regardless of previous employment status
        * People are already scared stiff of this thing, they will take effective safety measures if we teach them how. We don't need to resort to compulsion

## Section 5: The Road to Hell is Paved With Good Intentions: Censorship and Superstition
* Unconstitutional and arguably unethical lockdown policies
* Censorship of information that "contradicts" WHO (see Dr Erickson and Dr Masihi's message, which while containing statistical errors / imprecise language, (a) reflected their genuine beliefs, and (b) their overall conclusions and concepts espoused were absolutely correct IMO)

* Widespread superstition
    "Stay inside" (as opposed to "avoid activities that carry high risk of exposure to infected respiratory droplets")
        - social isolation is bad for health
        - healthy outdoor activity can be done safely and is critical for physical/mental health
        - also blatant hypocrisy on part of our leaders

    Many individuals walking around in latex gloves that ironically serve as fomite

    "Flatten the curve" started out as a reasonable proposal, indeed one we personally supported, and then morphed into essentially a thought-terminating cliche

## TL;DR - Elementary School Words Only

## The victory of superstition over science (META: won't include this section so that we can stay laser-focused, but will leave this in the initial commit)

**Public health officials and political leaders have taken the unprecedented step of recommending measures that appear to be based on superstition rather than based on an evidence-based understanding of the etiology of COVID-19 transmission.**

This phenomenom is most strikingly viewed in the widespread usage of "thought-terminating phrases", such as "flatten the curve", "stay home", etc. These phrases are used to terminate a discussion by pointing to a supposed self-evident fact, and dissent regarding the utility of these measures has been met with unprecedented levels of censorship that has been enabled, or more accurately shepherded, by platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.




## Debunking the unproven assumption that "the lockdown worked"

Care must be taken to distinguish between the various measures enacted:

- Recommending a minimum 6 foot distance between social groups
- Recommending widespread use of cloth facial coverings to attempt to curtail spread of respiratory droplets
- Closure of schools across the nation, from pre-schools up to universities.
- Forced shutdown of businesses across the country
